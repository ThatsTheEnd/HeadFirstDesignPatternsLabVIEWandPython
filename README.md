# HeadFirstDesignPatternsLabVIEWandPython
This repo is designed to host code where I try out stuff from the book "Head First Desgin Patterns".
This will be attempted in LabVIEW and Python.
Please be aware that while I *think* I know my way around these languages, I might not be the best teacher when it comes to design patterns, so don't judge too harschly here...
